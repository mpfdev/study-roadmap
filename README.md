# Personal Roadmap to Break-Into-Tech

Here will be placed all the topics I'm studying/studied.

My inspiration to create this repository is the #LearnInPublic, to be able to share what I'm studying - in public - and allowing to be a place to **find things that I wish I've found** when I was studying.

## How this repository works
The structure is not set, yet. There is a high chance that I'm going to change it as time flows. 
First, the Foundation folder will set the starting point to linear my understanding to get into full-stack development.
Every folder is going to have its structure, with a markdown file containing the resources and a brief text about what I've learned.
